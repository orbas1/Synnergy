# Synnergy Network Whitepaper

Synnergy Network is a research blockchain exploring modular components for decentralized finance, data storage and AI-powered compliance. The project focuses on extensibility and learning rather than production readiness. This repository contains Go implementations of the core ledger, networking and contract layers along with a command line interface used for testing modules individually.

The network uses a simplified consensus engine and lightweight transaction format. Smart contracts are executed inside a minimal virtual machine stub while more advanced features like sharding or rollups are represented as placeholders. Development stubs allow the CLI to run without a full node by providing a mock ledger and signing primitives.

Contributors should consult `AGENTS.md` for the staged development plan. Each module compiles independently so functionality can be implemented incrementally. The long term vision is a modular stack where components like state channels, automated market making and AI inference are pluggable services.
