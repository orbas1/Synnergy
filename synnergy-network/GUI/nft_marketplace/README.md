# NFT Marketplace GUI

This interface allows users to list and purchase NFTs on the Synnergy Network. It communicates with a backend service that interacts with the `NFTMarketplace` smart contract.

- `index.html` – user interface built with Tailwind CSS
- `app.js` – frontend logic for listing and buying NFTs
- `backend/` – Node.js service exposing REST APIs
