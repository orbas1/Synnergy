# Storage Marketplace GUI

This interface allows users to list storage offerings and open storage deals on
Synnergy Network. A simple Express backend exposes REST APIs that proxy calls to
the blockchain. The frontend is built with vanilla ES modules and Bootstrap 5.

## Development

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend && npm install
# Start the server
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` in a browser to use the GUI.
