# Node Types Manual

The Synnergy network utilises several specialised node classes to maintain
scalability and security.

- **Authority Nodes** – oversee sensitive operations and governance tasks.
  See the [Authority Node Type Manual](authority_nodes/Authority_node_type_manual.md)
  for a detailed description of their responsibilities.
- **Validator Nodes** – participate in consensus by proposing and validating
  blocks.
- **Bootstrap Nodes** – provide peer discovery services for new participants.

Additional node roles are documented throughout the `core/Nodes` directory.
