# Final Quality Gate

The Stage 30 assessment verifies that all preceding remediation stages
have been successfully completed and the project is ready for production.

## Verification Commands

- `go build ./...` – ensures all Go packages compile
- `go test ./...` – executes unit test suites
- `go vet ./...` – performs static analysis
- `npm audit` – scans JavaScript dependencies for vulnerabilities

## Current Status

Targeted verification of the `pkg/utils` package shows that it now
builds cleanly:

```bash
go build ./pkg/utils
go vet ./pkg/utils
```

Both commands completed without errors. However, a full project build
still fails. Running `go build ./...` produced the following output:

These unresolved compilation errors in the `core` package indicate that
earlier remediation stages have not been completed across the entire
repository.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve the outstanding compilation errors within the `core` package.
2. Re-run `go build ./...`, `go test ./...`, and `go vet ./...` until all
   commands succeed without errors.
3. Perform `npm audit` for GUI components to ensure dependency security.
4. Record the successful command outputs and obtain final sign-off for
   production deployment.

Until these tasks are completed, the project cannot pass the final
quality gate.
