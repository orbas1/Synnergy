# Final Quality Gate

The Stage 30 assessment verifies that all preceding remediation stages
have been successfully completed and the project is ready for production.

## Verification Commands

- `go build ./...` – ensures all Go packages compile
- `go test ./...` – executes unit test suites
- `go vet ./...` – performs static analysis
- `npm audit` – scans JavaScript dependencies for vulnerabilities

## Current Status

Running `go build ./...` produced the following output:

```text
pattern ./...: directory prefix . does not contain main module or its
selected dependencies
```

This indicates that a Go module definition (`go.mod`) is missing or
incomplete, preventing compilation of the project. As a result, earlier
stages—particularly Stage 1 (Module Initialization)—are not yet complete.

## Next Steps

1. Create a valid `go.mod` file at the repository root and ensure all
   packages are included.
2. Rerun the verification commands listed above and resolve any remaining
   issues.
3. When all commands succeed without errors, record the results and
   obtain final sign-off for production deployment.

Until these prerequisites are satisfied, the project cannot pass the
final quality gate.
