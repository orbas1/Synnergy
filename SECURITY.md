# Security and Encryption

Stage 15 of the Synnergy production plan focuses on hardening every module
through cryptography and secure coding practices.

## Zero-Trust Channels

- TLS 1.3 configurations must pin peer certificates and prefer X25519 curves.
- Use `core.NewZeroTrustTLSConfig` together with `core.CertFingerprint`
  to establish mutually authenticated channels.

## Biometric and Quantum Resistance

- `core.BiometricSecurityNode` provides biometric transaction validation.
- `core.QuantumResistantNode` and Dilithium signatures safeguard against
  quantum attacks.

## Threat Modeling

- **Network interfaces:** enforce pinned TLS certificates to block
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **CLI / API inputs:** validate and sanitize all external data.
- **Key storage:** minimize exposure of private keys and rotate regularly.

## Secure Coding & Static Analysis

- Follow Go best practices: check errors, compare secrets in constant time
  and avoid unsafe packages.
- Run the security scan:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/security_scan.sh
  ```

  High severity findings must be resolved before merging.
